      <div id="mainHeading">Server Side Rendering!</div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        This is one of those topics that can be quite simple to put into action
        without truly grasping it deeply! However, it's important to understand
        it for a better implementation.
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        In the recent days Server-Side-Rendering, in short SSR, gained a lot of
        popularity. But why? Everything was fine right? <br /><br />
        <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs">Next.js</a> has a really good
        documentation / blog on this. Therefore I will not deep dive into the
        Next.js's coding part, through this blog I simply aim to present a
        generic understanding of SSR in <i>plain english.</i>
      </div>

      <div id="contentImages">
        <center>
          <img src="img1.png" width="300" height="" />
        </center>
      </div>

      <div id="majorHeading">Introduction ü•Å</div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        <br />
        I will explain this by comparing the traditional
        <i>Client-Side-Rendering (CSR)</i>, using an example, <br /><br />
        <u>Client Side Rendering [CSR] <i>The old hero &nbsp;</i>:</u>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img2.png" width="350" height="" />
            <br />
            <i style="margin-top: 5px; font-size: 10px">Not really</i>
          </center>
        </div>

        Now, imagine you're at a restaurant, and you order a fancy dessert.
        <br />
        The waiter brings you the ingredients, the recipe, and all the tools
        needed to make the dessert right at your table. <br />
        You start following the instructions, mix everything together, and
        voil√†, you have a delicious treat ready to enjoy.
        <i>And then pay for that too..</i>

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img3.png" width="350" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        In web terms, this is what Client-Side Rendering does. Basically, when
        you visit a website that uses CSR, your web browser is like the waiter.
        It receives a basic set of instructions and ingredients (HTML and
        JavaScript), and it assembles the webpage on your device. This allows
        for dynamic and interactive experiences, like animations and real-time
        updates, but it might take a little longer for the page to show up
        initially because your browser has to do some work to put everything
        together.
        <br /><br />

        <u>Server Side Rendering (SSR):</u>

        <br /><br />

        Now, let's go back to the restaurant, but this time it's a bit
        different. You order the dessert, and the waiter goes to the kitchen to
        prepare it for you. They bring the finished dessert to your table, and
        you can start savoring it immediately.

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img4.png" width="350" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        In web terms, Server-Side Rendering works similarly. When you visit a
        website that uses SSR, the server (<u>like the kitchen</u>) prepares the
        complete webpage in advance, including all the toppings and decorations.
        Then, it sends the fully baked webpage to your browser. As a result, the
        page appears faster because most of the work has already been done on
        the server.

        <br /><br />
        <i>And then you pay for their service.</i>
        <br />
        <i>kinda feels like the right thing.. haha. Wait for it!</i> &nbsp;üòà
        <br /><br />

        <!-- Next.js is like a special tool that helps us do this, and in this
        article, we'll explore what it's all about and why it's so awesome for
        modern websites.
        <br />
        <br />

        Umm. Ok, I agree, maybe not the best example! But stick with me. -->

      <div id="majorHeading">Cool features of SSR</div>

      <div id="contentImages">
        <center>
          <img src="img5.png" width="350" height="" />
        </center>
      </div>

      <div id="mainBody">
        <u>#1. Faster Websites</u>: SSR makes websites open up faster because a
        lot of the work is already done before the site gets to you. This is
        especially helpful if you're using a slow internet connection or a
        not-so-powerful device. <br /><br />
        <u>#2. Better Search Results</u>: Search engines like Google prefer
        websites that use SSR. This makes it easier for them to understand what
        a website is about and show it to people who are looking for similar
        things. <br /><br />
        <u>#3. Good for Sharing</u>: When you share a link on social media, SSR
        helps show a preview of the website's content. This is important because
        you want the preview to match what's on the actual page. <br /><br />

        <u>#4. Works When Stuff Breaks</u>: Sometimes, parts of a website might
        not work properly because of technical issues. SSR helps by making sure
        you can still see the main stuff even if the fancy parts aren't working.

        <br /><br />
        <i> And there are a lot more which you can find in the internet... </i>
      </div>
      <br /><br />

      <div id="majorHeading">Then why not we "just" use SSR</div>
      <div id="mainBody">
        <i
          >with great power comes great responsibilities, and SSR sometimes
          fails to handle some of those responsibilities</i
        >

        <br /><br />
        Basically,

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img6.png" width="350" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        <u>#1. Slower Initial Load on Server: </u>SSR requires the server to do
        more work before showing you a website. This can sometimes slow down the
        server and make it take longer to send you the page. <br /><br />
        <u>#2. More Server Resources:</u> Because SSR does extra work on the
        server, it needs more power and resources. This can be a problem if a
        lot of people are trying to use the website at the same time.
        <br /><br />
        <u>#4. Limited Client-Side Interactivity</u>: While SSR makes things
        load faster, it can limit some of the fancy interactive features that
        make websites really cool. Some of these features might not work as
        smoothly with SSR. <br /><br />
        <u>#5. Caching Challenges:</u> Caching, which helps store and reuse
        information to speed up websites, can be a bit tricky with SSR. It
        requires careful handling to make sure the cached content is always
        up-to-date. <br /><br />
      </div>

      <div id="majorHeading">Conclusion üé∫</div>
      <div id="mainBody">
        <br />

        Like every other thing in life, SSR has its advantages and
        disadvantages. When to use CSR and when to use SSR is very highly
        dependent on the type of website you're trying to build.
        <br /><br />
        My opinion, if your website will require a lot of user interaction and
        dynamic updates (<u>like real-time chats or interactive maps</u>), CSR
        might be a better fit. However, if search engine optimization (SEO) and
        social sharing are important for your application, go with SSR.

        <div id="contentImages">
          <center>
            <img src="img7.png" width="350" height="" />
          </center>
        </div>

        Everything else seems managable.

        <br /><br />
